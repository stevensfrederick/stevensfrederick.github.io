    <p> Hey, are you thinking, what's Roblox? If so, then I'll let you in on a short summary about it: <br>Roblox is an MMORPG (massive muliplayer online roleplay game) in which you can play at any age. Also, it's available on Android, Windows, IOS, and wellnigh <em>any</em> platform you can think of!<br /> Beneath this introductory paragraph, I will elucidate why I like this and main features it holds!
     
    </p>
    <h2 id="heading">Why Roblox is my Favorite Game</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The first reason for why I favor Roblox is because of it diversity from most games. <br /> It's an open-world game with endless journeys, within it a variety of games to play. Wheter its in-games genres are role-playing, adventure, comedic, and more!</li>
    <li>Additionally, the socialization boosts the experience on it! <br /> Embedded in it are chat features, and the ability to choose who's your friend makes this similar to messenger applications + games!</li>

   <p>
    Sorcus, a Roblox administrator, says "Parties function similarly to Group Chat, with the added benefit of letting the party leader invite everyone to a game, and have them all enter on the same server. <br /> The improved party system makes playing ROBLOX games with your friends a much more straightforward process."

      Three <em>Ro</em>tastic Features   </h2>
    <!-- For the ordered list, images will be added during my coding class.--> <p>Now you know why I like this game and what Roblox is, if you didn't know before. <br /> But are you aware of Roblox's features that I like?</p> <ol>
    <h4>Dev. Exchange</h4>

    <li>
      The Developer Exchange Program (also known as DevEx) allows Robloxians to earn real money by exchanging their Robux from creating awesome (groups, games, etc) that are profitable on Roblox. <br />Therefore, my or any Robloxians' game development is like a paid hobby anywhere on the go!
      </li>
 
    
    <h4>Roblox Toys</h4>

           <li>
            Toys based off Robloxian personalities can be purchased at places like Target, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and more. <br /> Roblox toy packages are embedded of codes that be can redeemed  for in-game virtual items <a href="https://www.roblox.com/toys/redeem" target="_blank">here</a>. It's twice the fun when I and any Robloxians can roleplay with actual Robloxians, from changeable to interchangeable sets of lego-like mini-figures!
      </li>
    <h4> Roblox Game Creation System</h4>
    
     <img src="https://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/image011.png" alt="An image of developers using Roblox Studio in order to make game." width="650"/> <li>
    Roblox is a game creation platform which allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio. <br />Games are coded under a object oriented programming system utilizing the programming language, <a  href="https://en.m.wi kipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Lua</a>, in order to manipulate the environment of the game. <br />This helps me and any Robloxians who wish to power my and their imaginations, while building up their knowledge of coding!
